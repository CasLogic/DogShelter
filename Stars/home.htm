		 <h2>Find the Heart of a Stray ADOPT A PET AND SAVE A LIFE</h2>

				<p>Thanks to all those who donate and support our  special needs/cruelty cases. Your donations help us being able to provide for their recovery and medical care needed.
We can NOT do it without your help. </p>   

	 		 	<p>We are funded entirely by private donations and adoption fees!</p>

				<p>We are a 501 C non-profit animal rescue organization</p>

      <h3> ALL ADOPTION FEES & DONATIONS ARE TAX DEDUCTIBLE!</h3>

			<h4>WHO WE ARE:</h4>

				<p>As with most Animal Rescue groups, STARS is represented by an all volunteer 
Board of Directors.<br>
We all have full time jobs and families to care for. That does not stop us from 
finding some time to spend trying to save as many pets as possible!</p>
				<p>We are a very small foster based non kill Rescue, specializing in all-breed dog rescue.
We will pull sick animals and animals facing euthanasia from animal control facilities
all over the state if we have funds for care and space to foster.</p>

		<h4>STRAY POLICY</h4>
				<p>In compliance with Georgia State Department of Agriculture ordinance, STARS 
of GA is not able to pick up stray or abandoned animals. All stray and abandoned
 animals need to be reported at your local Animal Control Facility.</p> 

 				<p>We will take in owner surrenders if foster homes available.   
				<br>
				We do not have a location!
				<br>
				Our volunteers are dedicated to providing a loving home environment for each 
				foster dog. We strongly believe in educating the public on responsible pet care,
				safety and spaying and neutering.</p>
		<h4>YOU CAN HELP</h4>
				<p>Consider joining our Board of Directors or becoming a Foster Parent and 
				volunteering some of your time to help save lives!!!
				<br>
				We foster and promote the general welfare of animals by caring for homeless 
				animals in our community and work in conjunction with local shelters and other 
        rescue groups.
				<br>
				Our goals are to provide a safe haven for rescued animals or animals given up by
 				their owners; and to provide the best possible adoptions of available animals into
 				the home best suited to their personalities.</p>

				<p>Have a Voice for those Who DON'T HELP US HELP THEM! Thanks</p>
