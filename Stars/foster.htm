	<h3>Become a Foster Parent and SAVE A LIFE!</h3>

			<p>Make a difference, Foster a homeless Pet. A foster home is a family or 
			individual who provides a safe, supportive environment for our rescued Animals 
			while they are being evaluated/rehabilitated before placement in their permanent 
			homes.
			Foster homes are an extremely valuable part of our success.Our foster homes 
			are a very important part of the entire rescue operation. 
			Due to the size of our geographical area (and the amount of animals) it would
			 be unrealistic to try to house all of our rescued dogs at one address.</p> 

			<p>Rescues, usually, need some special attention and really do best when in
			 a situation that provides a lot of individual time and attention.  Our 
			 foster homes are awesome at doing just that. They assume the role of chauffeur, 
			 getting the dog to vet appointments or out for evaluation in society. 
			 Through careful observations, foster homes become the eyes and ears of the committee. 
			We stay in constant close contact with them as they guide us toward the 
			type of home the dog would be best suited for.We feel we have a better chance 
			at a successful adoption with this information.<br>
 			Most fosters stay in a foster home for a minimum of 10 days <b>but could stay in a foster home up to many months</b>.</p>

			<p>All Rescues bring with them some sort of "baggage" or history when they 
			come into our program. Some have been abused or neglected while others come 
			from seemingly wonderful homes. What all rescued Rescues have in common is
			 the fact that neither their new families, nor we will have had any control 
			 over the first few months or years of the dogs life. <br>
			Our job, through our foster people, is to try and figure out who the dog is. 
			These folks determine how much training the dog has had, what his or her 
			habits or quirks are, as well as health issues all in an effort to help us 
			place that particular dog in his or her perfect home.Some of them come with 
			some kind of behavior problem such as jumping up, barking, pulling on leash 
			etc, which was probably the reason why they were given up.<br>
			Our job is it to make that dog a good and well behaved companion with 
			understanding, love, affection, consistency and positive reinforcement.</p>

	<h3>What Does It Take To Foster?</h3>

			<p>You must have a safe, secure home and yard. Some of these dogs have been 
			known to scale 6ft fences without batting an eye.<br> 
			Do you have other pets? They must be ok with sharing their home (and you) with a strange dog.<br>
			You must have the time to take the rescued animal out into the world. 
			We need to know how he or she reacts to as many situations as possible. The 
			more we know about the dog, the better the permanent placement.<br>
			You must be able to take the dog to a vet, possibly many times, while caring for it.</p> 

  <h3>STARS has to confirm vet appointments, with selected Vets only, and will 
	be responsible for the vet bill connected to the rescue dog.</h3>

		  <p>Documenting the dogs time with you would be very helpful. A foster person
			 is truly the eyes and ears of the rescue committee. We use the information 
			 you provide us to determine where the dog should go, what new family would be the best match.<br>
			 You must be able to make the time to attend adoption events and meet with
			  possible, approved, adopters so your foster animal will get a fair chance to find a new family.<br>
			 You must be willing to work with your foster kid on basic obedience, if 
			 you foster puppies we need you to understand how to crate and potty train
			 as well. We will show you the how to using patience and positive reinforcement, in our orientation session.<br>
			 Finally, (and this is the hardest) you must be able to say good-bye when 
			 a home is found. Occasionally the foster home ends up adopting the dog.<br> 
			 That's ok by us if, realistically, yours is the best home. However, it's 
			 easy to let your heart override common sense. If you kept every Rescue that
			  you ever fostered, you'd have a houseful (and probably a divorce!) as 
				well as constant worry that you couldn't provide all the individual attention
				they need.
			 There is sadness at saying good-bye. There is also the satisfaction of 
			 helping a homeless pet move on to a bright future and welcome a new soul in need!</p>

	 <h3>STARS WILL be responsible for all approved vet visits, treatments, food
	 and anything else that might be necessary for the individual foster pet</h3>
	 		 <p>If you are willing to open your heart and home to an animal in need and
			  help us SAVE LIFE'S please ask us for our Foster Application.
			 After we have received and reviewed the application we will get in touch 
			 with you to set up a personal meeting</p>
